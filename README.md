# EnviProject

Envi is an android app that aims to raise awareness on the environment by providing features that allow users to identify common animals and plants, find nearby parks, and participate in environmental campaigns.

# Features
Identification: Envi utilizes the camera of the user's device to identify common animals and plants in their surroundings. The app uses image recognition technology to provide accurate results.

Nearby Parks: Envi uses Google Maps to show the user the nearest parks and green spaces. The app also provides information about the park, such as its size, facilities, and activities available.

Environmental Campaigns: Envi has a feature that allows people to host and join environmental campaigns during certain times at certain places. Users can create campaigns and invite others to participate in activities such as beach cleanups, tree planting, and other environmental initiatives.
